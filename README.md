Link to live [SITE](https://gorgeous-tiramisu-cb5830.netlify.app/)

## Description

So this task was given across different courses. We were provided a logo, slogan, target Audience, Unique selling points and site architecture:
- Home
- List of Jackets
- A jacket specific page showing the jacket
- A checkout page
- A checkout success
- About
- ContactList

In the first semester we were to build this using only HTML and CSS, come second semester we were to expand the usabilities of the website by adding JavaScript:
- The purchase/cart functionality
- The contact form with JavaScript validation
- Make an API with Wordpress
- Pull content from API instead of hardcoding it
- Using querystring to let the user navigate between products and product-list.
